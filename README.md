# S3 presigned URL

A presigned URL for Amazon S3 is a URL that has been signed with a valid AWS secret access key. This allows a user to access an S3 object without having to provide their own AWS credentials. The presigned URL is valid for a specified amount of time, after which it expires. Presigned URLs are useful for scenarios where you need to share access to an S3 object with someone who doesn't have their own AWS credentials, such as when sharing a file with a user who doesn't have an AWS account.
